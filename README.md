## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

A fully responsive AI chatbot built with **React.js** and styled with **TailwindCSS**, leveraging Googleâ€™s **Gemini 1.5 API** for conversational intelligence. The app features:

- Real-time chat interface with typing & loading animation
- Enhanced markdown rendering using `react-markdown`
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks (via `highlight.js`)
- One-click copy buttons for AI responses
- Mobile-friendly, performance-optimized UI
- Clean component structure, built for scalability

As a **B.Tech IT student & full-stack dev from Hyderabad**, I built this project to combine powerful APIs with sleek, intuitive design â€” demonstrating both technical and product sensibility.
